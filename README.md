# Carmot
This is an open source esp32s2 board project.
Carmot: The substance believed to be the main ingredient of the Philosopher's Stone.

# Aim
Design a board which will be a miles stone of IOT projects. This board will be IOT 's arduino. So who want to learn IOT apps with proffesional techniques (like use led strip, motor, relay ).

# Note for collaborators :

I am an elecktrical electronic engineer and I work on this to create a different perspective of IOT. I need help to designing board and programming (I am using esp-idf). If you agree to work together , I guarantee that we will change this IOT ecosystem together.

If you have the experience or motivation to will be expert of this zones:
            (pcb design,
            internet protocols(TCP-IP , websocket,udp , etc.),
            esp-idf ,
            circuit design)
            I will feel honor to work with you.
